## Caveats
- The sender of an escrow will temporarily be whitelisted to BOS executives. In the future anyone may be a sender
- The sender may only have one unfilled escrow at any given time, however they may have many filled escrows
- To fill an escrow the sender must transfer the `BOS` tokens to this contract. An unfilled escrow will be filled
- The receiver is considered as always approving the escrow. An approval must come from either the sender or the auditor
- The sender may only cancel an escrow that has not been filled
- The sender may only refund an escrow that has passed it's expiry
- Unapprove only removes an existing approval, if the action is made before the receiver uses the claim action
- A sender may extend the expiry but not shorten it
- The auditor may change extend or shorten the expiry
- The auditor may close an escrow. This is essentially the same as refunding it, however without waiting for the expiry to lapse
- The auditor may Lock and Unlock an escrow. This prevents ALL actions except unlock and actions made by the auditor.
